1. Can you explain what programming is in simple terms?

   language, so we use a programming language that both can understand (also language does not understand the syntax but the from the behind the scenes it does)

2. What is an algorithm, and why is it important in software development?
:: Algorithms are basically a group of tasks (steps) when doing a Big Task, 2 or more tasks connected to each other
   As a example when we want to cook rice, we have group of steps to complete...

3. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
:: Compiler is Translate our whole Code into a Machine code before running it - like before reading a book we print the whole book into our understandable language and read it,
